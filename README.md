# TodoApp
This Todo App backend provides functionality to manage todo items with a set of API endpoints: it allows you to create new todos with a title and description, delete todos by their unique ID, retrieve a list of all todos, fetch details of a specific todo by its ID, and update the title, description, or status of an existing todo by ID.
